Recursive functions have a base case and an argument changing towards base case

Every time you call a recursive function, memory allocated for the running of the function is pushed on to the call stack, 
that frame stays there until the function returns

For recursion, the function MUST be moving towards the base case

In python you can only make 1000 recursive calls before python fails

* Look up more clarification on call stack *

Running two recursive calls will cause it to run in a tree sort of structure, it is recommended to put pen to paper to really map it out
